## 💡 About Me

I'm a curious and motivated developer training in the project-based ecosystem of **42 Barcelona**. This unique, hands-on environment has taught me more than just coding; it has shaped my approach to problem-solving through:

* **Peer-to-Peer Learning:** I thrive in collaborative environments, where sharing knowledge and learning from my peers is key to our collective success. This has greatly improved my **teamwork** and communication skills.
* **Resilience & Frustration Management:** The 42 methodology is designed to challenge you. By tackling complex projects independently, I've developed strong resilience and the ability to stay focused and productive, even when facing difficult bugs or setbacks.

I love to understand how things work "under the hood" and my goal is to build software that is efficient, robust, and clean.

⚙️ Always open to collaborations and feedback!
