## 🚀 About Me

I'm a curious and motivated developer currently studying at **42 Barcelona**, where I’m learning through hands-on, project-based programming.  
I love solving low-level challenges, optimizing performance, and understanding how things work under the hood.

💡 I’m currently improving:
- Code testing and debugging skills  
- Continuous integration workflows  
- Memory management and optimization  

⚙️ Always open to collaborations and feedback!
